# JLS-breakdown Game

Simple 2D agar.io inspired game where you compose music just by eating
game elements from playground.

Each time you eat something -> some sounds is generated so you compose
your own music just by moving (aka changing your cursor on the browser screen)

I developed this game in 2017 for personal purposes.
In 2020 I did small refactor to hooks and typescript and publish it on my github
